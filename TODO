tests:
- write tests with [Enzyme with Mocha + Chai]

reducers:
- write new reducer for review; should handle:
	- undo/redo
	- removing card from review once done
	- getting next card (perhaps merge into the one reducer action)
	  this should check the card's schedule also?

- work out why webpack doesn't rebuild everything properly

containers:
- VocabCard should make questions not answerable once completed; should also probably
  store score as dict not array to enforce this in data as well

- FIX NAMING; card v review v etc.. it's all very confusing
- once reducer is fixed, actually wire up to show next card
- make sidebar clickable to change card
- handle case of completed quiz

components:
- write audio component
- fix styling

??? FINISHED QUIZ PART ???

- then need some way to generate cards + content
- which involves thinking about the user state + storage + async

- then that's the hard part done and we can go back to writing/implementing textbook and content and activities.. :)
